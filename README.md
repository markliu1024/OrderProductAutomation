# OpportunityProduct2OrderProduct App

## Description
- A simple app to automatically add all Opportunity Products that are related to an Opportunity record to an Order as Order Products when the Order is created and related to the given Opportunity record. 
- The "Copy Opportunity Product Lines" checkbox on the Order object will need to be set to true upon the Order record's creation in order for the automation to run.
